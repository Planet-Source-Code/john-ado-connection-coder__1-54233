This little utility allows the user to select an Access database and then generates the code 
to make a connection. It also allows the user to select a table from the database which then 
generates a simple SQL.
 
If there is sufficient interest I will continue to develope code writing programs and submit 
them to PlanetSourceCode. 

Although a few votes would be nice I am more interested in feedback. 

Taken from an idea by Carlos Vara, thanks.

Update 16:14 07/06/2004
When Testing this routine under Windows 2000 with Original Visual Basic 6.0 Learning edition there
were problems. However after installing Visual Studio 6 Service Pack 5 all was ok. Let me know if 
you are unable to run the programs.

Also ensure that you add references to

	Microsoft ADO.ext for DLL and Security
	Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.5 Library

in the projects.
