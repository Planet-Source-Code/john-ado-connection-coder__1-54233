### Description

This little utility allows the user to select an Access database and then generates the code

to make a connection. It also allows the user to select a table from the database which then

generates a simple SQL.

Also attached are instructions for use and a test program

If there is sufficient interest I will continue to develope code writing programs and submit

them to PlanetSourceCode.

Although a few votes would be nice I am more interested in feedback.

Taken from an idea by Carlos Vara, thanks.
